<h5><b><font color="#2d96bd">|</font> Deadlines</b></h5>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I maintain two links of deadlines for conferences that I&#39;m working on. The Security and Privacy Conference Deadlines are <a target="_blank" href="https://sec-deadlines.github.io/"><i class="fa fa-calendar-alt"></i></a> and AI Conference Deadlines are <a target="_blank" href="https://aideadlin.es/"><i class="fa fa-calendar-check"></i></a>.</p>

<h5><b><font color="#2d96bd">|</font> Papers</b></h5>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The paper that most surprised me is <a target="_blank" href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7958578">IoT Goes Nuclear: Creating a ZigBee Chain Reaction</a> from Eyal Ronen, Colin O&#39;Flynn, Adi Shamir and Achi-Or Weingarten because they used <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_theory"><em>Percolation theory</em></a>, which starts from random graph and doesn&#39;t have relevant Wikipidia link before 2017, in IoT real world. It took me long time to understand the content of this paper.</p>

<h5><b><font color="#2d96bd">|</font> Basketball</b></h5>
